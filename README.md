# MOCO Rush

MOCO Rush is an novel, experimental lottery Dapp on Mossland where the last player to press the button before time runs out wins half of the prize pool. This thrilling game extends its timer slightly with each button press, creating a dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience.

Players use MOC tokens to buy tickets, directly contributing to the ever-increasing prize pool. The game's end time is randomly determined, adding an exciting layer of strategy for when to press the game button.

Featuring real-time prize pool updates and a referral reward system, MOCO Rush encourages continuous player engagement. Live updates fuel the competition, while the referral system rewards players for expanding the game's community.
